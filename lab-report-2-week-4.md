## Links to the failure-inducing test files
In order to test the prorgram, there are four different test files created.

**1. Test file 1 symptom**

Attached is the problem of the test-file 1. In this test case, there's a bug whereas the code runs into infinite loop. Originally, the test file has one empty lines at the end of the test file, which leads the program go into the infinite loop and eventually crush. This error can be simply fixed by deleting the empty line. Later, when running this file, the progam returns the expected output.
